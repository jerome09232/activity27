CSS Grid is a powerful layout system in CSS that allows you to create complex, responsive, and two-dimensional web layouts with ease. It provides a way to design both rows and columns in a grid structure, making it ideal for building both regular and responsive web designs. Unlike Flexbox, which is a one-dimensional layout system (either rows or columns), CSS Grid works in two dimensions, meaning you can design both the horizontal and vertical axes simultaneously.

Key Features of CSS Grid:
Grid Container: To use CSS Grid, you start by defining a "grid container" using the display: grid; property. This container holds the grid items (child elements).

Grid Items: The child elements inside the grid container automatically become "grid items." These can be placed in specific grid cells or areas.

Defining Rows and Columns: You can define the number of rows and columns in the grid using grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns. These properties allow you to set fixed or flexible sizes for each row and column.

Placing Items: Items can be placed into specific cells of the grid using grid-column and grid-row properties, or using the shorthand grid-area.

Flexible Layouts: CSS Grid supports fractional units (fr), which divide available space into flexible portions, allowing for more adaptive layouts.
